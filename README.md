# beeGame
A simple bee game to try jasmine

`bower i`
and open app/test.html to see the tests specs or open app/index.html

Currently the game is running on the console, once I have finished the interface details I will publish the game running on the screen.

After I finish of testing jasmine I'm thinking of try babel and browserify.
